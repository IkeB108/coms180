  <h2>Professor #1 Paraphrased Interview Transcript</h2>
  <h3>What has inspired/motivated you to pursue a career in education?</h3>

<p>It‚Äôs been an indirect path for me personally. It should be prefaced that I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a lot of consistency there with professors. Different faculty have very different experiences, and there‚Äôs no clear universal theme. Most of it is rewarding, and it‚Äôs satisfying and gratifying, but even different departments are extremely different. Different mathematicians even would have different answers.</p>

<p>For me personally, I was a math tutor in college, I TA‚Äôd a class in college, and I enjoyed those things. I was always a social person. I liked working with other people, and at the same time, I liked math a lot, and this was a good combination of those two things. After college, I tried to teach high school for a year, and it was a disaster. I was really bad at it, particularly the classroom management side. Partly I was inexperienced and naive, and partly you also get put in a school that‚Äôs not very good when you don‚Äôt have experience. There was violence, and gang stuff. It felt like being more of a prison guard than a teacher. They were forced to be there, and they had all kinds of stuff going on outside of the classroom. It was not what I signed up for, and not what I prepared for.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what inspired me to go back to school, teaching math at the college level, where students actually choose to be there. I wanted to teach people who wanted to learn. I still get plenty of students who learn calculus who don‚Äôt want to be there‚Äîlike they just want to be an engineer or something like that‚Äîbut they‚Äôre at least not legally obliged to be here. So then I went to get my PhD. That‚Äôs when I first found my experience with math research, which I liked a lot. It‚Äôs hard, but I loved learning about truths about the universe that nobody had ever seen before. Things no human being had ever studied. It was pretty exciting, so I did fall in love with that as a grad student, even though my original motivation was to become a teacher at the college level. A place like my university is a good place for someone like me because you get a good balance of both, which is what I‚Äôd like. I want a balance, so that neither teaching nor research gets stale. If you keep teaching the same thing over and over, you stop learning things from it, and I want to be a life-long learner. I also want to have human interactions. I don‚Äôt just want to sit in my office all day doing research and having no social interaction.</p>

<p>And I also want to feel like I‚Äôm helping people in some way. I‚Äôd like to think my math research will someday be useful to somebody, but realistically, it‚Äôs probably not going to be that helpful to anyone. It‚Äôs more creating something because it‚Äôs beautiful, not because it‚Äôs going to change the world. It‚Äôs possible somebody will pick up my research, like a physicist, in a hundred years, and do something meaningful with it, but it‚Äôs unlikely. But with teaching, I actually have an impact on people‚Äôs lives every day. There‚Äôs a lot more to the job than just teaching them math: I‚Äôm helping them with emotional support, and setting them up for future success, and a lot of the gratifying part is helping college students grow up and become self-confident and have self-efficacy. People can become who they want to be. You could almost be like a math psychiatrist with the math trauma that people have had. The psyche they have that they‚Äôre not good enough or not smart enough at a young age, it does harm to our society. Our society devalues math in a way that is really toxic. People basically brag about being bad at math in a way that they wouldn‚Äôt about English. When I tell people what I do (not people through the university but other people such as family) there‚Äôs almost a disgusted look on their face. They are very comfortable saying that they hate math. I can‚Äôt imagine there‚Äôs another career out there where anyone would feel so brazenly confident saying to somebody‚Äôs face, ‚ÄúI hate doing what you do‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs not socially acceptable, but it is socially acceptable to hate math.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a complicated job, particularly because I‚Äôm doing more administrative stuff now. The students I work with cover a pretty broad spectrum. The Calc I students are almost entirely engineering majors who don‚Äôt want to be there; a few of them like math, but most of them are passionate about civil engineering or building race cars, or things that are a lot more concrete and tangible than the esoteric math. They only see math as a hurdle, or a hoop to jump through to do what they really want to do. I want to change their minds that it‚Äôs not just a practical, useful thing, but it‚Äôs also a beautiful, fun and interesting thing. Right now, I‚Äôm teaching an upper division senior level math class. Every student in there is a graduating math major. I don‚Äôt need to convince them that math is cool. They‚Äôre almost done‚Äîthey already ‚Äúdrank the Kool-Aid‚Äù. So that‚Äôs not my goal in that class, since they‚Äôve already self-selected.</p>

<p>Sometimes I don‚Äôt even feel like it‚Äôs practical. Sometimes it‚Äôs more about the meta-skills you get from studying math: logical, deductive thinking, rationality, interpreting data. Things like that. I don‚Äôt think anyone needs to compute an integral in their job. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really going to be that useful to any of those students, but that‚Äôs kind of missing the point. That‚Äôs one of the problems with the way our culture thinks about math. I really don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs very practical for the vast majority of students, the individual topics we cover. But I do think that the problem-solving skills and deductive reasoning metaskills they learn are extremely important. You can‚Äôt teach it at the meta-level. You have to teach it by doing concrete calculations and things like that. It‚Äôs not like teaching literature or writing by having people read Shakespeare or something like that: not every writer needs to have read Hamlet. The topics we cover are just examples, the practice of mathematical thinking.</p>

<p>I do think people lack practical math skills in general in society. Ideally I‚Äôd like everybody to be extremely math literate, but maybe that‚Äôs not realistic. When people don‚Äôt understand math literacy to the point that it harms them financially, not understanding the basic logic that‚Äôs at play through policies in their lives and things like that, that‚Äôs a problem. But also at the societal level, being able to do things like interpret statistics in the media: there‚Äôs a lot of harm being done by the few people who understand statistics and can weaponize and twist statistics for their own purposes, and the population is not math literate enough to recognize it when they see it. They don‚Äôt recognize logical fallacies when they see them. If P implies Q, does that mean Q implies P? It doesn‚Äôt, but people use that kind of faulty logic all the time in politics and media, and it harms our society. So yes, I think we need a lot more math literacy, and that‚Äôs also true about the specialized fields I teach. The engineers I teach are not always equipped to go to the workforce. The standards are dropping so quickly in this country, but not in other parts of the world like China and India. It could do harm to the standing of America in the world when our education system reverts and our graduates are no longer really truly educated. Right now we attract the best and brightest from China and India to come here, but it could flip in the future if our education system is no longer the envy of the world if we keep diluting the standards we have.</p>

<p>	In terms of the good I want to do in my life, it‚Äôs sometimes big-picture global thinking, or personal thinking, like for example, if there‚Äôs a particular student that I want to help be a happy productive person. There‚Äôs local things too, like for example, wanting to improve my university or my city or California. Sometimes, I‚Äôm forced to choose specific actions that have specific effects at specific levels. Personally, I‚Äôm trying to do a little bit of each. There‚Äôs only so many hours in the day and so many years I can give. It‚Äôs harder to move the needle on the big-picture level than at a smaller individual level. I‚Äôm more confident in my ability to change a student than changing the whole world.</p>

<h3>What components of your work do you find most meaningful?</h3>

<p>I feel like it‚Äôs meaningful to have a big impact on single students, through advising and mentoring, and at the research level, I could have a smaller impact on the larger world of mathematics. I like to have a little bit of each. I‚Äôve thought a lot about the cascading effect, where if you choose to work at the individual level, then you can still have a global impact if you influence a student who could go on to have a global-scale influence on the world.</p>

<p>Of course, other people have impacted me to get here. I had an influential math teacher in high school who got me interested in math, and a PhD advisor who got me interested in math research. Part of my high school teacher‚Äôs legacy is that he impacted me, a student who went on to have an impact on a bunch of other students here. You have to choose time-wise and energy-wise where you want to work.</p>

<p>With my math research, if I do it at this sort of super high level, maybe some student in Sri Lanka is going to read one of my papers and then get their PhD based on that, and then my more global-level work could have an impact on a more individual level. The consequences are going to be what they are. They may or may not have downstream effects. Hopefully they do‚Äîyou want that‚Äîbut you can‚Äôt control what your students go on to do.</p>

<p>You have very limited interactions with these people for three hours a week for 16 weeks, and then they‚Äôre gone forever. There‚Äôs only so much you can do at the individual level. You can‚Äôt get into people‚Äôs heads, you don‚Äôt know what else they have going on in their lives or what history they‚Äôve had, but you can hope that your work can get to some of them, and for the ones that don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs ok. I don‚Äôt think everyone needs to love math, and students may not be in the right place in their lives, and I appreciate that they may just have to sometimes focus on what‚Äôs right in front of them. </p>

<p>I have a personal life, I have kids and parents, financial stuff, health stuff, and when those things come up, everything we‚Äôre talking about here has to take a back seat, and I understand that it can be the same with students. The reality is that students sometimes have more practical pressing issues, and sometimes there‚Äôs only so much that can be done.</p>

<p>Not entirely blaming yourself for failures of students is important, but hard. It‚Äôs hard to feel like you‚Äôve failed at your job. It‚Äôs hard to give up on someone and say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm walking away.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard especially when you‚Äôve committed time and energy. There‚Äôs not just an emotional side‚Äîthere‚Äôs also the investment of your own time and energy, and you don‚Äôt want to feel like it was all for nothing. What does it mean for a student to learn algebra? How do you measure those things? Exams, or what else? Especially for students who are neurodivergent in some way, it‚Äôs hard for [neurotypical people] like us to say whether students understand this stuff or not. You can‚Äôt get in their head, and the only way you can try to measure it is with the ways you‚Äôre used to measuring it, and they may have an understanding which they‚Äôre just not communicating in a way that you understand yourself. Some of that is inevitable, and I don‚Äôt have answers for how to do it differently. My Calc I students, I need to prepare them for Calc II with a different instructor, and I can wax philosophical all day about whether students are learning more than they‚Äôre showing me, but ultimately my job is to prepare them for Calc II.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt make the norms that are socially expected about preparing people for the workforce, but I still need to help prepare students for that. The humanist side of me says that humans are getting more than we‚Äôre measuring, but the realist in me says that the student has to get to the next class and find a job, and that‚Äôs the sort of box they have to fit in. High school is mandated‚ÄîI‚Äôve had high school students who were brought into my class by the police department in handcuffs. They were forced to be there.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd like to imagine in a perfect world that each student could have a personalized education, but we don‚Äôt live in an ideal world. I recognize that there‚Äôs a reality, and if I‚Äôm too out into outer space, I‚Äôm not necessarily serving my students as best as I could. It‚Äôs much easier to do at the college level where there‚Äôs more freedom than at the high school level. I couldn‚Äôt balance my ideals with the reality in high school. That‚Äôs hard for any person to do in any job, but I‚Äôm much happier here at a college like this. I can strike a reasonable balance between my ideals and reality. What that balance looks like is different for different people. Some more realistic, more practical people want to just have the skills they‚Äôll need in the workforce. There are other faculty who don‚Äôt think about those things, and they just want their students to be enlightened, through whatever subject they teach. It‚Äôs a broad spectrum, and I‚Äôm probably somewhere in the middle. These things are good to reflect on‚Äîimportant to reflect on. Are you doing what you want to be doing?</p>

<h3>Overall, would you say that you are satisfied with your job?</h3>

<p>I‚Äôm happy to say that yes, overall this is a satisfying job for me, even though I have my complaints. Some of the faculty I think are very unhappy in their job here and may not say they‚Äôre satisfied.</p>

<h3>What changes do you wish you could make to the departmental curriculum, such as the courses offered, or other factors of the department?</h3>

<p>I think I have a great department. I could complain a lot more about structures outside of my department. My department is doing the best it can with all the constraints above and below and on all sides. There are a lot of external factors that are really making it more and more important. There‚Äôs administrative stuff, and there‚Äôs political stuff like the university budget being cut, and not investing in education properly at the political level. That‚Äôs not blaming my bosses‚Äîthere‚Äôs all kinds of social undercurrents, like our society devaluing math and rigor and critical thinking and education in general that‚Äôs coming not from top down, but from bottom up. I think there are massive problems in K-12 education that are sending students to us that are woefully unprepared for both math and adulthood in general. They‚Äôre not coming in at 18 years old ready to be self-sufficient and ready to be responsible for their actions .There are all kinds of poor decisions being made by people who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre talking about. For example, the AB705 Bill is the California legislature deciding (without a single mathematician) that they want to get rid of Algebra and Pre-Calculus at universities, so all students just go straight into Calculus. That‚Äôs a horrible decision that will affect my life and my students.</p>

<p>There was a high school teacher who posted in a subreddit for professors‚Äîit was the most relevant post to me in the few minutes that I was browsing the subreddit. Posts like that related to some of my worries about how we‚Äôre teaching high school, not just pedagogically (since we‚Äôre making math miserable for students and giving students math trauma by burying the creative interesting parts and emphasizing the most boring, meaningless, rote parts, and not even useful parts, so we have students who come in who can hardly do anything), but also the social developmental side, where in high school you grow up, and in college, you should be prepared for taking personal responsibility, and time management. These trends that are happening at the high school level are creeping into the college level. These policies that are harmful to students are being imposed from the top down. You have administration whose job is to get our graduation rates up, and they don‚Äôt care how it‚Äôs done, or if it means sacrificing the quality of the education, even if it means graduating students who don‚Äôt know the content that a student with a bachelor‚Äôs degree should know, or how to be prepared for adulthood. Admin‚Äôs job is to improve the stats.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs an inverted incentive structure at the admin level at college and high school levels. It‚Äôs doing incredible amounts of harm to students, and it seems to be getting worse. Covid made it a million times worse. The goal should not be to give out as many degrees as possible, especially as those degrees become less meaningful, even in our department which I think is doing well. We‚Äôre graduating students who don‚Äôt know math at a high school level. In terms of Photomath and other AI tools, they‚Äôre an issue in our lower-level classes, but those don‚Äôt affect me anymore since I‚Äôm doing higher level math, where those tools are useless.</p>

<p>The work is meaningful either way: when you‚Äôre given even weaker students, it‚Äôs sometimes even more meaningful to help them grow up and help them be where they need to be, since they‚Äôre so underprepared. But we could do more good, and have a bigger effect. We have a finite amount of time and hours, and I want to maximize the amount of good I can do with that time. I could do a lot more if some of these issues were fixed. It feels like I have to work so much harder to make the same amount of difference. It‚Äôs meaningful, but it feels less efficient, and I‚Äôm not doing as much good as I could be. Some of it is administrative, but it‚Äôs more than that. A lot of it is very cultural. It‚Äôs also these other cultural trends we see: things like social media lowering attention spans, and lowering people‚Äôs ability to work hard for a long time on one thing. There‚Äôs politicization of everything, which is really toxic. There‚Äôs a lot of other issues here. 50% blame top down policies, and 50% blame bottom-up cultural trends that are doing a lot of harm as well. But those are harder to fix than the administrative things. If I was president, I could fix those things‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how to fix the social trends, but the policies can be fixed, which I think is why they‚Äôre more frustrating. They‚Äôre solvable problems, self-imposed in some ways. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre more frustrating.</p>

<h2>Professor #2 Paraphrased Interview Transcript</h2>

<h3>What has inspired/motivated you to pursue a career in education?</h3>

<p>A crucial motivator is how central my own professors were in encouraging me to start an undergrad as a Comm major. My Comm professors were very supportive, and I appreciated their guidance. They really helped to create a space for me and my classmates. My professors‚Äô ability to cultivate spaces of belonging and dialogue and conversation really made a difference to me. I hope I can do the same as an instructor. I‚Äôm interested in teaching and learning with people and not at people.</p>

<p>Prior to becoming a comm major, I was a business major. I took business classes, and then took the inevitable math class that I didn‚Äôt do well in and got a D, and I decided it maybe wasn‚Äôt for me. It wasn‚Äôt until I took a public speaking class that I had a professor who fostered a good sense of community, and after taking Comm classes, it was a whole other level of fostering a good community.</p>

<p>I had professors that inspired me. Also in my career I‚Äôve found my own teaching style that works for me. Not just aims and objectives but new teaching styles. Instructors always start by replicating other instructors until they find their own thing. I had a professor in undergrad where I took seven classes from him, so for a time I was doing what he did, which was socratic seminars. And since then, I‚Äôve had help with creating more facilitative approaches to instruction. You kind of Frankenstein your way through it to create your own teaching approach.</p>

<h3>Does your work align with your personal values? Have your personal values been shaped by the work at all?</h3>

<p>I‚Äôd like to think so. It depends on what type of values. I value the personal growth and self-reflection. The sole focus of teaching in my work aligns with my values of being reflective. Education is an important component in any person‚Äôs life, no matter what level it is.</p>

<p>I think it benefits society, but it‚Äôs also difficult to reconcile with that knowing that in different parts of the country, and even with California, it‚Äôs been undervalued and underfunded in some junctures. I still teach with that awareness that not everyone values it as much as they did ten years ago. And not everyone can afford it as much as they could ten years ago. That makes it hard to give a solid ‚Äúyes it does‚Äù kind of answer. There are many factors that have contributed to my changed perception of this over time. Two of the biggest grand-scale factors across the country would be Covid, how the pandemic forced people to reevaluate the feasibility and affordability of a college education. There‚Äôs been a lot of obstacles and constraints we‚Äôve been tasked with to help students who were on lockdown for the better part of a year from online to in-person education. And politically, our education infrastructure and valuing of education has been a lot as well, because there have been efforts in other states to underfund education. In California, college used to be free. And then tuition became a component in the eighties that now has made college graduation more difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve had a lot of students who came from high school right out of Covid. It was a huge mountain to climb with them; I say with them because none of us were immune to what Covid did to our sense of belonging and the community feeling fractured. That made the task of being an educator feel a lot more important; what can we still do to make sure students are getting the tools and resources they need to have a successful education, but still in a safe way that removes such a vital component, which is the in-person dialogue?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint right now what the situation is like with students not being acclimated from Covid. I have students right now whose writing never got a lot of TLC. But I also teach classes at a community college where I don‚Äôt get a lot back from students since it‚Äôs an online class. There are glimmers of hope here and there but we‚Äôre still dealing with that hump. It‚Äôs a testament to what we have to continue facing and adapting to in light of what Covid dealt us.</p>

<h3>What components of your work do you find most meaningful?</h3>

<p>The one most immediate thought is as an advisor in our department, I‚Äôm able to advise students on the classes they need to graduate and fulfill. GE requirements, major requirements, etc. It‚Äôs been happening a lot where students say to me that it‚Äôs their first time getting advising, which is kind of wild to me that they‚Äôve been here for two years and haven‚Äôt gotten advising. It‚Äôs happened a lot more recently, and moving forward, I want to find ways to encourage students to reach out to professors early on and get advising earlier on instead of waiting till their junior year.</p>

<p>The second meaningful thing to me is learning about students‚Äô lived experiences and encouraging them to bring that into the classroom‚Äîencouraging them to think about the world around them through lenses they wouldn‚Äôt have thought of before. We grow up in a predominantly Western culture, and we may not think of experiences outside of the US or how power influences communication. The perspective-sharing and perspective-taking and perspective-growth is the other meaningful component.</p>

<p>I feel like if a professor can take their content from just pure content to thinking about it from other lenses and experiences, I think it‚Äôs really valuable.</p>

<h3>How has the meaningfulness of your work in education compared with other jobs/careers?</h3>

<p>I started teaching in my masters program as a graduate student, and my career went straight from there, so it‚Äôs kind of the only thing I‚Äôve ever known. Prior to becoming a college instructor, I only had a few jobs. I do think that one point of comparison is how that meaningfulness of work is valued or returned or acknowledged. There‚Äôs something left to be desired in terms of giving instructors good pay and valuing them in ways that aren‚Äôt so strenuous and conducive to burnout. In other nine-to-five jobs, you do your work there and you leave it there. As meaningful as teaching is, we more often bring the work home with us. The working conditions are a bit much.</p>

<h3>Have you struggled with burnout in your career, and what were possible contributing factors?</h3>

<p>In addition to the things I previously mentioned, another component is the nebulousness of our roles in this job. For example, in addition to teaching, I also have to do service to the department and do research. The teaching load of any professor is usually a four-four load; four classes taught in the fall, and four classes taught in the spring. We teach twelve units every semester. It‚Äôs really stressful when you have to teach four sections of any given class. Most professors have to do, say, two class preparations, but I‚Äôm still teaching four sections, with anywhere from 25 to 35 students per section. It‚Äôs a lot. But the nebulousness of expectations, and what are the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts, what are the things we should know, those would be helpful to combat burnout, and more recently I‚Äôve interfaced with colleagues who‚Äôve helped me and supported me and told me, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs some things you should know going on in the job‚Äù. That‚Äôs been helpful. The expectations are there, but they do vary from discipline to discipline, and major to major. There‚Äôs also this deep-seeded inclination to over-promise or over-perform, because we never really know what‚Äôs enough, so there‚Äôs this kind of ‚ÄúI want to do all the things‚Äù so that that way I‚Äôm seen as a valuable contributor to our university or our institution. There‚Äôs also the conflicting messaging we see of ‚Äúyou need to do this, teaching service, showing growth‚Äù but also ‚Äúwe value self care and wellbeing‚Äù and things like that, so it‚Äôs like, well, which is it going to be? </p>

<p>Another factor is student evaluations. They come at the end of every semester, and I find them to be concerning. In theory, they sound ideal for measuring instructors, but they‚Äôre a huge source of concern for how someone is evaluated for doing their job. It‚Äôs especially precarious for professors who are women and women of color. It‚Äôs really concerning, because their character and personhood are evaluated more so than their teaching. Our teaching is depending on how students are giving this information. Some students want to tear into professors. You can have one good semester and one bad semester, a set of great constructive comments that are helpful and positive, and then you have people who might get very accusatory or hostile in your evaluations. That‚Äôs something you have to be subject to when you go up for review every year, when your supervisors review you.</p>

<h3>To you, how do your students‚Äô actions or performance in the class reflect on their attitude about the course?</h3>

<p>I think their actions/performance and feedback and engagement tells me something about how interesting and relevant to their personal study and personal interests and major the course is to them. Anything from not coming to class is just like, okay, at first glance, it‚Äôs like, you never really wanted to be here, so why are you here? Students might not be aware of it, but we notice things like showing up physically and also actually making a presence. If you just come to class and you‚Äôre just present, but not mentally, we notice it, and we make an inference about whether you care about the class or you don‚Äôt. Anything from participation in the class to not showing up to just going through the motions, those things are indicative of your receptions of the class.</p>

<p>Speaking from my own experience, I think one of the positives (and drawbacks) to this is you get so invested in the stuff you teach that you have some students who are invested in it, and others who are just there to get the credit. Over time you‚Äôre just like, okay, they‚Äôve made their bed, and they can navigate through the classes they need to. I‚Äôll still be there to support them if they want to seek it out, but I can‚Äôt always focus on wondering what I can do more to get them interested. They are their own agents. They have agency, and they also need to figure out how this class connects to what they want to learn or what they want to gain.</p>

<h3>What changes do you wish you could make to the departmental curriculum, if any, such as the courses offered, or other factors of the department?</h3>

<p>The only changes I‚Äôd make would be:</p>

<p>1. A class about teaching students how to read academic scholarship in communication. We teach subareas of communication, like org, rhetoric, media, health, etc. and we all research comm in different ways. It would help students learn about the different research paradigms and fields.</p>

<p>2. A class on critical approaches to communication‚Äîstudying from a critical lens‚Äîwould be good: teaching about power and systemic ideology and influences. There are so many things happening locally and around the world that can help students connect how we communicate/not communicate, and the influence that power and domination has on that.</p>

<h3>What changes do you wish you could make to the learning environment, and why?</h3>

<p>If I could change anything, one thing I‚Äôd change is tuition‚Äîmaking it more affordable and accessible‚Äîbecause that would make it so that students who are paying out of pocket wouldn‚Äôt have to commute from places far and wide and do side hustles. Smaller-size classes would be helpful, but we‚Äôve had ups and downs with that. The learning conditions would be significantly improved if students didn‚Äôt have to pay so much and feel such a burden and have their personal lives diminished, and on top of that, it‚Äôs hard for us to have such big class sizes and have such big workloads.</p>
