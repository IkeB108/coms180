  <h1>The Six-Point Checklist<br><span style="font-size:medium;font-weight:100;">for Faculty Job Satisfaction</span></h1>
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>The Six-Point Checklist is a guide for leaders in educational organizations of all kinds, to foster an environment where faculty feel that their work is meaningful, satisfying, and valued.</p>
  <p>The six points draw from peer-reviewed research on job satisfaction, meaningfulness in work, and burnout, as well as interviews with two anonymous professors.</p>
  <p><b>Please note</b> that the quote blocks from the interviews with professors are paraphrased instead of direct quotations. To read a full paraphrased transcript of the interviews, <a href="transcript.html" style="background-color: rgb(253, 212, 239);">click here</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>The Checklist:</h2>
  
  <p class="emoji">üó©</p>
  <input type="checkbox" checked id="checkbox1"><label for="checkbox1">#1: Clear Communication of Responsibilities and Expectations</label>
  <p>It's important for faculty to have a clear understanding of the responsibilities and expectations of their roles.</p>
  <p>When faculty have to wonder whether they're ever doing ‚Äúenough‚Äù in terms of their contributions to the school, including their research, their teaching, and other responsibilities, it contributes to <b>role ambiguity</b>, which is a lack of clear understanding about responsibilities and expectations of a role.<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0893318991004004005">[1]</a></sup></p>
  <p>Role ambiguity contributes to burnout.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="qbb">Anonymous Professor</p>
  <p class="qb">The nebulousness of our roles in this job affects burnout. For example, in addition to teaching, I also have to do service to the department and do research. (...) The nebulousness of expectations, and what are the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts, what are the things we should know, those would be helpful to combat burnout, and more recently I‚Äôve interfaced with colleagues who‚Äôve helped me and supported me and told me, 'here‚Äôs some things you should know going on in the job'.</p>
  <p class="qb">There‚Äôs also this <b>deep-seeded inclination to over-promise or over-perform</b>, because we never really know what‚Äôs enough, so there‚Äôs this kind of 'I want to do all the things' so that that way I‚Äôm seen as a valuable contributor to our university or our institution.</p>
  <br><br><br>
  
  <p class="emoji">‚á¢</p>
  <input type="checkbox" checked id="checkbox2"><label for="checkbox2">#2: Change-Communication</label>
  <p>When any organization is undergoing significant changes, it's important for those changes to be communicated effectively. Effective change-communication is "relevant, timely, complete, understandable, accurate, and reliable."<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/08933189221087633">[2]</a></sup> It also acknowledges employees' concerns.</p>
  <p>Effective change-communication is correlated with perceived meaningfulness of work, which is in turn correlated with less depression and less stress.<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/08933189221087633">[2]</a></sup></p>
  <p>One example of a situation where effective change-communication was essential was the Covid-19 pandemic, where the future of most organizations became uncertain with stay-at-home orders.</p>
  <br><br><br>
  
  <p class="emoji">‚ùä</p>
  <input type="checkbox" checked id="checkbox3"><label for="checkbox3">#3: Supportive Communication</label>
  <p>Supportive communication in the workplace can help mitigate role ambiguity, which in turn improves feelings of job satisfaction and occupational commitment.<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03634529209378869">[3]</a></sup></p>
  <p>One example would be exercises in acknowledging faculty's strengths and positive affirmations.</p>
  <p>An inherent challenge with teaching is grappling with the fact that you won't always know how to best help some of your students (or even, whether you can). This is just one example of a reason to exercise reassuring communication with faculty.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="qbb">Anonymous Professor</p>
  <p class="qb">Especially for students who are neurodivergent in some way, it‚Äôs hard for [neurotypical people] like us to say whether students understand this stuff or not. You can‚Äôt get in their head, and the only way you can try to measure it is with the ways you‚Äôre used to measuring it, and they may have an understanding which they‚Äôre just not communicating in a way that you understand yourself. Some of that is inevitable, and I don‚Äôt have answers for how to do it differently.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Another avenue to consider is rethinking the systems for <b>student evaluations</b>.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="qbb">Anonymous Professor</p>
  <p class="qb"><b>I find student evaluations to be concerning.</b> In theory, they sound ideal for measuring instructors, but they‚Äôre especially precarious for professors who are women and women of color. Their character and personhood are evaluated more so than their teaching. Our teaching is depending on how students are giving this information.</p>
  <p class="qb">You can have one good semester and one bad semester, a set of great constructive comments that are helpful and positive, and then you have people who might get very <b>accusatory or hostile</b> in your evaluations. That‚Äôs something you have to be subject to when you go up for review every year, when your supervisors review you.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Systems for student evaluations should strive to encourage fair, objective, constructive feedback, and reduce hositility, aggression, and bias.</p>
  <p>The ideal changes that should be made to student evaluations will vary from one educational institution to the next. However, a good place to start is to brainstorm changes by taking inspiration from a <b>statistical analysis</b> of previous student evaluations. Previous student evaluations could be analysed to answer questions like:</p>
  <p><i>How consistent is students' feedback of a particular professor?</i></p>
  <p><i>Are things like word choice, tone, length, or subject correlated with an instructor's demographics, like race, gender, or age?</i></p>
  <p><i>Are there any correlations between students' performance in the class, and what they write in evaluations?</i></p>
  <p>One example of a change that could be informed by the data is to have students answer some evaluative questions at the beginning and end of the course, to see how much their opinions are affected by first impressions. But there are plenty of creative approaches that could be explored.</p>
  <p>And crucially, the data analysis could serve as <b>important context for supervisors</b> when student evaluations are factored into the reviewing process.</p>
  <p>At the end of the day, educational institutions have limited control over what students say about their instructors. But what they have more control over is the feedback provided by people employed by the organization.</p>
  <p>Organizations could place a greater emphasis on supplementing student evaluations with other feedback that is rigorously moderated to help ensure that it‚Äôs fair, constructive, objective, helpful, and supportive.</p>
  <br><br><br>
  
  <p class="emoji">üéìÔ∏é</p>
  <input type="checkbox" checked id="checkbox4"><label for="checkbox4">#4: Prepare Incoming Students</label>
  <p>When newly incoming students are underprepared for the kind of work that will be expected of them, it hampers instructors' ability to provide the level of education they want to provide. </p>
  <p>This can be another contributor to role ambiguity, as instructors are left having to wonder what to do to get their students through the curriculum.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="qbb">Anonymous Professor</p>
  <p class="qb">I worry about how we‚Äôre teaching high school, not just pedagogically (since we‚Äôre making math miserable for students and giving students math trauma by burying the creative interesting parts and emphasizing the most boring, meaningless, rote parts, and not even useful parts, so <b>we have students who come in who can hardly do anything</b>), but also the social developmental side, where in high school you grow up, and in college, you should be prepared for taking personal responsibility, and time management. These trends that are happening at the high school level are creeping into the college level.</p>
  <p class="qb">With more-prepared students, we could do more good, and have a bigger effect. We have a finite amount of time and hours, and I want to maximize the amount of good I can do with that time. I could do a lot more if some of these issues were fixed. It feels like I have to work so much harder to make the same amount of difference. It‚Äôs meaningful, but it feels less efficient, and I‚Äôm not doing as much good as I could be.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="qbb">Anonymous Professor</p>
  <p class="qb">I‚Äôve had a lot of students who came from high school right out of Covid. It was a huge mountain to climb with them; I say with them because none of us were immune to what Covid did to our sense of belonging and the community feeling fractured. That made the task of being an educator feel a lot more important; what can we still do to make sure students are getting the tools and resources they need to have a successful education, but still in a safe way that removes such a vital component, which is the in-person dialogue?</p>
  <p class="qb">It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint right now what the situation is like with students not being acclimated due to Covid. I have students right now whose writing never got a lot of TLC.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Of course, educational organizations have no control over what incoming students learn at the schools they previously went to. However, organizations <i>can</i> provide incoming students with supplemental materials or assignments (mandatory or optional) that give students a basic understanding of the expectations that instructors will have, all before instructors even meet the students.</p>
  <p>Examples could include books to read, study guides, practice exams, writing assignments, workshops for grammar and spelling, or for Elementary, Middle, or High school levels, vocabulary lists.</p>
  <p>This takes some of the burden of bringing students up to speed off of the shoulders of instructors.</p>
  <br><br><br>
  
  <p class="emoji">‚úØ</p>
  <input type="checkbox" checked id="checkbox5"><label for="checkbox5">#5: Engaging Courses</label>
  <p>Instructors have an appreciation for and understanding of the value of the curriculum that is not always reciprocated by students.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="qbb">Anonymous Professor</p>
  <p class="qb">With teaching, unlike with research, I actually have an impact on people‚Äôs lives every day. There‚Äôs a lot more to the job than just teaching them math: I‚Äôm helping them with emotional support, and setting them up for future success, and a lot of the gratifying part is helping college students grow up and become self-confident and have self-efficacy. People can become who they want to be. You could almost be like a math psychiatrist with the math trauma that people have had. The psyche they have that they‚Äôre not good enough or not smart enough at a young age, it does harm to our society.</p>
  <p class="qb">Sometimes it‚Äôs more about the meta-skills you get from studying math: logical, deductive thinking, rationality, interpreting data. Things like that. I don‚Äôt think anyone needs to compute an integral in their job. (...) But I do think that the problem-solving skills and deductive reasoning metaskills they learn are extremely important.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Engaging curriculum encourages students to build personal connections with professors, which is known to contribute to job satisfaction and feelings of personal accomplishment.<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03634529209378869">[3]</a></sup></p>
  <p>Additionally, it's been shown that workers feel that their work is important when it's perceived as essential by others.<sup><a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0893318990003003004">[4]</a></sup> So when students have a deeper appreciation for the importance and value of the material, it helps instructors feel that their work is meaningful, essential, and impactful.</p>
  <p>There are two important notes here: firstly, fostering student engagement is challenging, and it may require new, creative, out-of-the-box ideas, and experimentation. But finding ways to overcome these challenges should be a very high priority. Students learn more when they are more invested in what they're learning. This is pivotal for both the students and the instructors.</p>
  <p>Secondly, professors already have some agency with how they structure their course. However, expecting them to come up with creative, out-of-the-box methods for making the curriculum engaging would be a heavy burden to place on them, especially when they are restricted by rules that limit their options.</p>
  <br><br><br>

  <input type="checkbox" checked id="checkbox6"><label for="checkbox6">#6: The Funding Solutions</label>
  <p>This final point is an umbrella category for solutions which involve substantial funding.</p>
  <p>When college students have more affordable tuition, more affordable living expenses such as housing and meal plans, and more affordable educational expenses such as textbooks, it enables them to live closer to campus, to work less, to have more time and energy to dedicate to schoolwork, to be more physically and mentally present in class, and to form more meaningful, more personal connections with professors. These factors contribute to increased job satisfaction and perceived meaningfulness of work for professors, and decreased burnout.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="qbb">Anonymous Professor</p>
  <p class="qb">If I could change anything, one thing I‚Äôd change is tuition‚Äîmaking it more affordable and accessible‚Äîbecause that would make it so that students who are paying out of pocket wouldn‚Äôt have to commute from places far and wide and do side hustles. The learning conditions would be significantly improved if students didn‚Äôt have to pay so much and feel such a burden and have their personal lives diminished.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="qbb">Anonymous Professor</p>
  <p class="qb">I have a personal life, I have kids and parents, financial stuff, health stuff, and when those things come up, everything we‚Äôre talking about here has to take a back seat, and I understand that it can be the same with students. The reality is that students sometimes have more practical pressing issues, and sometimes there‚Äôs only so much that can be done.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In the same vein, when instructors have smaller class sizes, fewer classes to have to teach, fewer responsibilities, and more flexible options for what courses they teach, these factors also contribute to decreased burnout and increased job satisfaction.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="qbb">Anonymous Professor</p>
  <p class="qb">The teaching load of any professor is usually a four-four load; four classes taught in the fall, and four classes taught in the spring. We teach twelve units every semester. It‚Äôs really stressful when you have to teach four sections of any given class. Most professors have to do, say, two class preparations, but I‚Äôm still teaching four sections, with anywhere from 25 to 35 students per section. It‚Äôs a lot.</p>
  <p class="qb">(...)</p>
  <p class="qb">There‚Äôs something left to be desired in terms of giving instructors good pay and valuing them in ways that aren‚Äôt so strenuous and conducive to burnout. In other nine-to-five jobs, you do your work there and you leave it there. As meaningful as teaching is, we more often bring the work home with us. The working conditions are a bit much.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Pointing out these kinds of solutions may not seem very helpful, since it already goes without saying that changes like these would benefit students and faculty. The reality is that educational institutions have limited money and resources, and they can‚Äôt afford to throw money at every problem.</p>
  <p>However, if administration needs any more reasons to consider any of these funding solutions, it‚Äôs valuable to know that instructors‚Äô job satisfaction, perceived meaningfulness of work, and burnout are all factors to add to the list of reasons.</p>
  <p>Additionally, armed with the knowledge that all six of the points on the six-point checklist‚Äîincluding the funding solutions‚Äîaddress the true roots of the problems plaguing job satisfaction for instructors, educational organizations can recognize that looking for solutions that don‚Äôt address the roots of these problems may not be a good use of time and resources. Knowing which solutions are not effective is still actionable knowledge.</p>
